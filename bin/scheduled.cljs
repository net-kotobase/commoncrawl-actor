    nbb bin/scheduled.cljs

  ## Why a wrapper rather than launchd calling `tick.cljs` directly

  Both of this actor's real credentials come from places `bin/tick.cljs`
  itself cannot read from under launchd:

  - `CF_CATALOG_TOKEN` — the macOS Keychain, fetched by exact service +
    account name (`gftd.cf`/`API_TOKEN`), never by enumerating the store
    (this workspace's safety floor #7).
  - `COMMONCRAWL_MURAKUMO_TOKEN` — `commoncrawl.live-http/murakumo-token`
    falls back to a `KAGI_BIN`-driven `kagi get`, and kagi cannot show its
    Keychain-unlock prompt under launchd (superproject skill
    `secrets-location-map`, and `cloud-itonami/otent`'s own
    `bin/scheduled.cljs` hits the identical wall for its catalog token).
    This reads `~/.gftd/commoncrawl-actor-murakumo-token` (mode 600)
    instead — the file-based fallback this workspace's own convention
    documents for exactly this problem (see `MURAKUMO_SERVICE_TOKEN`'s
    entry in `secrets-location-map/references/murakumo.md`).

  ## Missing credentials degrade the tick; they do not stop it

  Unlike `otent`'s wrapper — whose catalog token IS its premise, so a
  missing token refuses the whole cycle — neither credential here is this
  actor's premise:

  - Missing `CF_CATALOG_TOKEN` only degrades that tick's `:iceberg` field
    to `{:ok? false :error :could-not-answer ...}` (`commoncrawl.live-iceberg`'s
    own documented contract). Net-kotobase ingestion is unaffected.
  - Missing the murakumo token degrades every page's `:advise` proposal to
    zero confidence, which `commoncrawl.policy`'s existing confidence
    floor already routes to HOLD — the actor's designed default for an
    untrusted/unavailable advisor, not a new failure mode this wrapper
    invents.

  So this logs a warning per missing credential and runs the tick anyway.

  exit: whatever `bin/tick.cljs` itself exits — today always 0 unless an
  uncaught exception escapes it. A HELD tick is this actor's normal,
  designed outcome (a fetch miss, an out-of-scope seed, low confidence),
  not a scheduler failure, so this wrapper does not invent a nonzero exit
  for it."
