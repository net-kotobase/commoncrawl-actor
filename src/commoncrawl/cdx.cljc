(ns commoncrawl.cdx
  "Common Crawl CDX index query + WARC-envelope stripping — the PURE,
  portable core of the `:fetch` StateGraph node. Ports the LESSONS of two
  existing clients rather than their code:

    - `dossier.commoncrawl` (cloud-itonami-isic-8291, JVM-only
      org.httpkit.client): `url=` is a MANDATORY CDX query param (there is
      no bare-domain/keyword search — confirmed live, ADR-2607182400), and
      a genuine no-match is HTTP **404 with a real JSON body**
      (`{\"message\": \"No Captures found for: ...\"}`), NOT a bare 200 or a
      transport error. A naive '200-only' parser silently degrades every
      real no-match into 'unknown' (nil) instead of 'confirmed absent' ([]);
      this ns keeps that distinction (see `captures-of`'s docstring) so a
      caller can tell the two apart, same as dossier.commoncrawl does.
    - `kenchi.commoncrawl` (kotoba-lang): the index-query -> per-capture
      WARC-range-fetch -> extract shape, with the actual binary WARC fetch
      left as an INJECTED capability (never inlined into the pure ns).

  Every network call is a capability injected by the caller — `fetch-fn`
  (CDX index queries) and, for the WARC body, an already-decompressed-text
  string handed to `strip-warc-envelope`. This keeps the whole ns free of
  IO, so it runs identically under :clj (tests, `clojure -M:test`) and
  :cljs (nbb, the actor's real runtime — repo-wide runtime priority). The
  REAL network/gzip glue (curl range-fetch + zlib gunzip) lives in
  `commoncrawl.live-http` (nbb-only, `.cljs`), never here — same
  'pure core vs. injected real IO' split as `commoncrawl.llm`/
  `commoncrawl.embeddings`/`commoncrawl.kotobase`."

  `fetch-fn` is `(fn [{:keys [path query]}] -> already-parsed-result)`:
  the SAME seam `dossier.commoncrawl`'s `live-http-fn` hands to its own
  `captures-of` after parsing the real newline-delimited-JSON (a match) or
  404-JSON (`[{:message \"No Captures found for: ...\"}]`, a no-match) body

  necessarily a 200 (confirmed live: www.sec.gov's newest CC-MAIN-2026-25
  capture was a tiny 301-redirect stub with no page content — picking
