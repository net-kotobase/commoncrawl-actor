  "Client for the self-hosted murakumo embedding engine
  (ADR-2607192200 2026-07-19 addendum): `POST https://api.murakumo.cloud/
  v1/embeddings`, an OpenAI-Embeddings-compatible verbatim proxy in front
  of murakumo's `:llamacpp-embed` head (BGE-M3-class, ~1024-dim dense
  pooling), gated behind the SAME bearer-token auth as `/v1/messages`
  (`local-murakumo.worker/auth-ok?` — `x-api-key` or `Authorization:
  Bearer <token>`).

  Pure orchestration + response parsing only — no IO. `embed-fn` is the
  ONLY injected capability: `(fn [text] -> response-map | nil)`, where
  `response-map` is the ALREADY-JSON-parsed OpenAI Embeddings response
  shape (`{:data [{:embedding [...]}] ...}`) — tests inject a fn returning
  a canned map; the real nbb implementation
  (`commoncrawl.live-http/embed-fn`) does the actual curl POST + JSON
  parse."

(def default-model
  "murakumo's embeddings route is a single fixed self-hosted head (no
  model-name routing table the way /v1/messages resolves `murakumo-main` —
  see local-murakumo.worker/embeddings-route, a verbatim proxy with no
  `:model` dispatch), but the OpenAI Embeddings request shape still expects
  a `model` field; llama-server's OpenAI-compatible server accepts any
  non-blank value here and ignores it for routing (the model actually
  served is whatever `--embedding` head is running), so this is
  informational/logging value, not a live routing key."
