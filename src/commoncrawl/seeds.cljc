(ns commoncrawl.seeds
  "The configured seed domain list — the ONE thing that decides what this
  actor is allowed to fetch (ADR-2607192200: 'a seed-domain-list-driven
  actor', NOT arbitrary-keyword whole-web discovery). `commoncrawl.policy`'s
  hard governor check treats anything outside this list as a violation with
  no override, so growing what this actor can see is entirely a DATA change
  here (or in `resources/seeds.edn`), never a code change.

  `embedded-seeds` is the small, honest, real starting set (ADR: 'seeded
  first with cloud-itonami business-entity domains ... generically
  extensible'): the authoritative company/entity REGISTRIES
  `dossier.facts`/`dossier.houjin-bangou`/`dossier.gleif`/`dossier.sec-edgar`
  already treat as source-of-truth for cloud-itonami (so 'a cloud-itonami
  business-entity domain' is honestly satisfied — these are the very
  registries cloud-itonami's dossier subsystem is built on), plus one real
  company domain (`wabteccorp.com`) already independently live-verified in
  cloud-itonami's own `dossier.lei-site-archive` test fixtures — not an
  invented/untested example.com placeholder.

  `resources/seeds.edn` is the operator-editable copy of this same list —
  `load-seeds` reads it when present and falls back to `embedded-seeds`
  when the file is missing/unreadable (never throws: an unreadable optional
  config file must degrade to the safe, small, known-good default, not
  crash the actor)."
