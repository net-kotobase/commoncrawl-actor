  "Offline demo runner — drives four seeds through one IngestActor with
  entirely mocked (in-process, no network) capabilities, so the whole
  intake -> fetch -> advise -> govern -> decide -> commit/hold path and
  the Governor's three rules are visible without any live dependency.

    seed1  a configured seed, clean high-confidence extraction  → commit
    seed2  a domain NOT in the seed list                        → hold (out-of-scope, hard)
    seed3  a configured seed, but the CDX/WARC fetch misses      → hold (fetch-miss)
    seed4  a configured seed, extraction confidence below floor  → hold (low-confidence, soft)
