(ns commoncrawl.store
  "SSoT for this actor's OWN bookkeeping — NOT the ingested content itself
  (that lives in net-kotobase, the actual write target; see
  `commoncrawl.kotobase`). This store holds only what the durable outer
  loop (`commoncrawl.loop`) needs across ticks: the append-only decision
  ledger, a dedupe index of already-ingested URLs, the seed round-robin
  cursor, a per-tick fetch budget counter, and a best-effort single-runner
  lease — the `:agent.loop/*` / `:agent.tick/*` / `:agent.lease/*` /
  `:agent.budget/*` datom families skill `build-actor` describes for a
  durable outer loop, kept as separate attr families (not folded into one
  blob) so each can be queried/reasoned about independently.

  Two backends behind one `Store` protocol, same 'swap, not a rewrite'
  discipline every actor in this workspace uses:

    - `MemStore`     — atom of plain EDN. Deterministic default for
                       dev/tests/`commoncrawl.sim` (no deps, no IO).
    - `DatomicStore` — `langchain.db`-backed (Datomic-API-compatible EAV),
                       built on `kotoba-lang/langchain-store`'s shared
                       codec/identity-schema/event-stream helpers
                       (`enc`/`dec*`/`identity-schema`/`read-stream`/
                       `append-blob!`) rather than a 191st hand-rolled
                       `enc`/`dec*` pair (ADR-2607141600) — pure `.cljc`,
                       runs in-process offline (tests) or against a real
                       kotoba-server pod by swapping `langchain.db`'s
                       `:db-api` (see `langchain.kotoba-db`), unchanged
                       here.

  LEASE CAVEAT (documented honestly, not glossed over): `acquire-lease!`
  is a best-effort single-runner guard for a SINGLE process's atom
  (MemStore) or a single in-process langchain.db connection (DatomicStore)
  — it is NOT a distributed lock across multiple processes/machines. That
  is an acceptable scope for a scheduled routine that a scheduler (not
  multiple concurrent workers) invokes one tick at a time; it is NOT
  sufficient if this actor is ever run by multiple concurrent schedulers
  against the SAME store instance."
