  "Real IO for `commoncrawl.iceberg`'s `:iceberg-sync-fn` seam: appends
  already-shaped rows to the `net_kotobase.commoncrawl_page` Iceberg table
  in Cloudflare R2 Data Catalog (bucket `net-kotobase-datalake`, account
  `4da88288dc30d9ee257f319d3c33ecf0`, the same Cloudflare account
  `cloud-itonami/otent` already uses for its own tables).

  nbb-only (`child_process`/`fs`/`path`), per `commoncrawl.live-http`'s own
  ns docstring discipline: real IO stays out of every `.cljc` namespace so
  the offline test suite never touches a subprocess or the network.

  `cp/spawnSync` (blocking), NOT the async `cp/spawn` `cloud-itonami/otent`
  moved to on 2026-08-28 — that move fixed a real problem (a blocking
  Iceberg commit inside `Promise.all` starves EVERY sibling feed's
  deadline), but this actor has no sibling fetch running concurrently: one
  `bin/tick.cljs` invocation is a single sequential pass over at most
  `budget-cap` (default 3) seeds, called once, then the process exits.
  There is nothing here for a blocking call to starve.

  `--create` is passed on every append call. `scripts/iceberg_append.py`
  only actually creates the table when it is genuinely absent (see its own
  docstring), so this is safe on every run, not just the first — the same
  choice `otent.cljs`'s `commit!`/`create?` plumbing makes explicit at the
  call site; here it is simply always true, since this actor has exactly
  one destination table."
