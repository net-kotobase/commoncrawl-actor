  "The `:advise` node's contained intelligence — an LLM extraction call
  following the `70-tools/bmc/src/gftd/cli.cljc` `llm-complete-fn`
  convention: `murakumo-main` alias resolution (CLAUDE.md's repo-wide
  mandatory LLM model-selection rule, ADR-2607173100 — never hardcode a
  concrete model id), a single `(fn [prompt] -> completion-string)`
  capability, dual OpenAI/Anthropic response-shape tolerance. This is
  DELIBERATELY not `cloud_itonami.murakumo`'s `GatewayInference` client —
  that ns's own docstring says it has zero callers and shouldn't be wired
  yet (ADR-2607192200 decision 5).

  Like `talent.hrllm`, this is a *smart-but-untrusted advisor*: it returns a
  PROPOSAL (category/summary/entities + a self-reported confidence), never
  a committed record — `commoncrawl.policy`'s `:govern` node is the only
  thing that decides whether a proposal is trustworthy enough to reach
  `:commit`. An unparseable/garbage response degrades to a safe, empty,
  zero-confidence proposal (never a thrown exception, never a fabricated
  guess) — same discipline as `talent.hrllm/parse-proposal`.

  `complete-fn` is the ONLY capability this ns takes: `(fn [prompt] ->
  completion-string)`, exactly `gftd.cli`'s `llm-complete-fn` return shape —
  tests inject a fn returning a canned EDN string (see
  test/commoncrawl/llm_test.cljc); the real nbb implementation
  (`commoncrawl.live-http/llm-complete-fn`) shells out to `curl` against
  `api.murakumo.cloud/v1/messages`, same idiom as `gftd.cli`'s own :cljs
  branch."
