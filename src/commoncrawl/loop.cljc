  "The durable OUTER loop — NOT an always-on process. This actor is meant
  to be invoked by a scheduled routine (cron / claude-code `schedule`
  skill / an equivalent BMC-style 'tick' driver, ADR-2607192200: 'a
  durable outer loop (tick/lease/budget/crash-recovery), not an
  always-on process'). Each call to `tick!` is ONE bounded, budgeted pass
  over (a slice of) the seed list — never an unbounded inner loop.

  State that must survive ACROSS separate `tick!` invocations lives in
  `store` (see `commoncrawl.store`'s `:agent.loop/*` / `:agent.tick/*` /
  `:agent.lease/*` / `:agent.budget/*` families), not in this process's
  memory:

    - `:agent.loop/cursor`  — round-robin position in the seed list, so
      consecutive ticks cover DIFFERENT seeds rather than always
      re-attempting the first `budget-cap` entries.
    - `:agent.lease/*`      — a best-effort single-runner guard (see
      `commoncrawl.store`'s LEASE CAVEAT) so two overlapping scheduler
      firings don't both drive the seed list at once; a TTL'd lease is
      also the crash-recovery mechanism — a run that dies mid-tick
      without releasing its lease simply lets the NEXT scheduled
      invocation proceed once the TTL elapses, rather than wedging the
      actor permanently.
    - `:agent.budget/*`     — fetches already spent against a `tick-id`,
      so a retried/resumed tick (same `tick-id` passed back in) doesn't
      exceed the original budget even across a crash+retry.
    - `:agent.tick/*`       — an append-only per-tick summary log,
      separate from the commit/hold decision ledger.

  Also drives the OPTIONAL, SECOND `:iceberg-sync-fn` capability
  (`commoncrawl.iceberg`/`commoncrawl.live-iceberg`): after the seed loop
  finishes, whatever committed this tick is shaped into Iceberg rows and
  handed to one batched sync call — never per-seed, so a 3-page tick makes
  one Iceberg commit, not three. Net-kotobase (`:ingest-fn`, inside
  `commoncrawl.operation`'s graph) remains the only write the GOVERNED
  graph itself performs; the Iceberg sync happens strictly after, on
  already-committed data, and its own success/failure never changes a
  seed's `:disposition` or is written to the decision ledger — see
  `commoncrawl.iceberg`'s ns docstring for why it is a projection rather
  than a second premise."

  Returns {:skipped :lease-held} if another owner currently holds the

  `commoncrawl.store/append-tick!`):
    {:tick-id :attempted :committed :held :budget-used :budget-cap
     :results [{:seed :disposition} ...] :iceberg {:ok? :attempted ...}}.

  `:results` never carries the full page/proposal/embedding state — only
  `:seed`/`:disposition`, same shape as before this fn grew Iceberg sync —
  because `:results` is what `store/append-tick!` persists into this
  actor's OWN bookkeeping store, and that store must not become a third
  copy of page text/embeddings (net-kotobase and the Iceberg table are
  already two; see `commoncrawl.iceberg`'s ns docstring). The richer
  per-seed state used to build Iceberg rows is discarded once this fn
  returns."
